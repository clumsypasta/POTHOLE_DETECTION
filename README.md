# POTHOLE_DETECTION
Pothole detection using YOLO_V5 algorithm

PROJECT ABSTRACT :
This project focuses on detecting potholes From real time video feed that is generated from the onboard bus cameras.
In this project we used YOLO V5 algorithm that is a computer vision algorithm that is efficient and reliable in terms of fast processing and quick inference generation.
The model is trained on 17,000+ images, the average accuracy (mAP) is 92.00%

PROJECT APPLICATION :
The camera is mounted on the bus and its realtime feed is sent over the cloud. 
After retreiving the video feed, it is processed and fed to the ML model for generating results.

TCHNOLOGIES USED :
Python : ML modelling, data preprocessing, Data pipeline integration
HTML,JS,CSS : Used for devloping Website.
